### Visualization Methods

Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA)

Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM)

t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP)

## Visualizating the MNIST Dataset

### 1. PPCA

what parameters can be adjusted for better results?

### 2. GPLVM

what parameters can be adjusted for better performance?

### 3. t-SNE
what parameters can be adjusted for improved outcomes?

*Perplexity*: Try values between 5 and 50 to see if it improves separation. Higher perplexity considers more global relationships, which may reduce overlap.

*Learning Rate*: Adjusting the learning rate (e.g., between 50 and 500) might change how clusters are positioned.

### 4. UMAP

what parameters can be adjusted for improved outcomes?

*n_neighbors*: Try increasing or decreasing this to change the emphasis on local versus global structure.

*min_dist*: A smaller min_dist can create tighter clusters, while a larger value can spread points further apart.
