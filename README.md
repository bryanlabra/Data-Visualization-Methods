**Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP)**

## Visualization Methods: MNIST Dataset

### 1. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA)

what parameters can be adjusted for better results?

### 2. Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM)

what parameters can be adjusted for better results?

### 3. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
**Perplexity**: Try values between 5 and 50 to see if it improves separation. Higher perplexity considers more global relationships, which may reduce overlap.

**Learning Rate**: Adjusting the learning rate (e.g., between 50 and 500) might change how clusters are positioned.
