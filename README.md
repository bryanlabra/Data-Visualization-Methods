### Visualization Methods

Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA)

Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM)

t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP)

## Visualizating the MNIST Dataset

### 1. PPCA

what parameters can be adjusted for better results?

### 2. GPLVM

what parameters can be adjusted for better performance?

### 3. t-SNE
what parameters can be adjusted for improved outcomes?

*Perplexity*: Try values between 5 and 50 to see if it improves separation. Higher perplexity considers more global relationships, which may reduce overlap.

*Learning Rate*: Adjusting the learning rate (e.g., between 50 and 500) might change how clusters are positioned.

### 4. UMAP

what parameters can be adjusted for improved outcomes?

*n_neighbors*: Try increasing or decreasing this to change the emphasis on local versus global structure.

*min_dist*: A smaller min_dist can create tighter clusters, while a larger value can spread points further apart.

### 5. Isomap

*Increase n_neighbors*: This may help in clustering more global relationships.
*Experiment with Data Subsets*: Sometimes, Isomap can perform better on smaller, more focused subsets of data.

### 6. LLE

### 7. Autoencoders

Model Adjustments:
	•	Increase Hidden Layers: Adding more hidden layers with larger dimensions in the encoder and decoder might help the model capture more complex features.
	•	Add Convolutional Layers: For image data like MNIST, convolutional autoencoders (using convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers) can capture spatial hierarchies and may perform better.
	•	Regularization Techniques: Adding dropout or batch normalization layers can help improve generalization and potentially create better-separated clusters.
Training Adjustments:
	•	Increase Training Epochs: Allowing the autoencoder to train for more epochs might improve the reconstruction quality and latent representation.
	•	Tune Learning Rate: A lower learning rate could help the model converge to a better solution, albeit more slowly.
